## Upper Air Patterns
#### Hurricane Sandy (2012)
Unusual circumstance in which a tropical storm forms South East of the continental United States, is diverted North of the tropical region of the U.S. and demonstrates an abnormal recurvature into the New York area.

#### Pattern Matching
The Sandy vortex diversion attributed to a blocking ridge over the Atlantic and a low-pressure trough over the continental U.S. bringing the vortex inland via Fujiwhara effect.

The goal of the program is to rank weather data by likelihood of facilitating the same storm diversion that occurred during late October 2012.
This match likelihood is determined through the strength of a northeasterly wind isolated to the East coast.
