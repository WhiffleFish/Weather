Data Description

AOD QC2		- MODIS AOD with quality 'good' and 'very good'
AOD QC3		- MODIS AOD with quality 'very good' only
conc		- column mass concentration in microgram/cm^2
avgbinQC2	- number of bins used for averaging for AOD QC2 data
avgbinQC3	- number of bins used for averaging for AOD QC3 data

Note: 
	1. The concentration unit in the text files are given as (um/cm^2), please read them as microgam/cm^2
	2. Since AOD QC3 uses higher quality control criteria, it can have missing data for the pixel in which AOD QC2 data shows real values.
	   For analysis I would use AOD QC2 instead of AOD QC3.
